# About

This is a template for C++ in Windows.

I use the tool chains below:

- CMake
- Fish
- Neovim
- clangd

Notice that, you should replace the line in the `.clangd` file below to your own include path of this project,

```
"-I/home/sonnycalcr/EDisk/Templates/LinuxCppTemplate/includes", # you should replace this to your own include path of this project
```

Besides, after cloning this repo to your local device, you need to execute an additional command,

```sh
chmod +x *.sh
```

Then, have fun writting C++ in Linux.
